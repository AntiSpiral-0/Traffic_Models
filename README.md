This is a traffic light detection system that uses YOLO11 for initial detection and then applies a custom RGB pixel analysis algorithm to classify the colors as red, yellow, or green. The interesting part is the color classification - instead of using pre-trained models, I created my own approach that analyzes pixel density and channel dominance to determine the traffic light state. I also have a vehicle segmentation pipeline that combines YOLO11 with SAM 2.1 for real-time video processing. Both systems have practical applications in autonomous vehicles and smart traffic management
